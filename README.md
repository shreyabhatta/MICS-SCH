# Modelling Incentives in Computer Science

Motivated by the consideration of economic incentives within computational systems and by computational considerations in economic systems.

# Overview
Many 21st-century applications require the design of software or systems that interact with multiple self-interested participants. We covered vocabulary and modeling tools to reason about such design problems. Emphasis was given on understanding basic economic and game theoretic concepts that are relevant across many application domains, and on case studies that demonstrate how to apply these concepts to real-world design problems. Case studies include Bitcoin and Ethereum, eBay's reputation system, Facebook's advertising mechanism etc.

# Project Objective
1. Develop thinking and tools which will enable us to think about engineering designs in a way that we can better incorporate incentives of the interacting  parties in our design.
2. Getting familiar with various technologies that are around us as well as how incentives arise in their design.

# Description
1. Analysed **Modern Markets**, learnt how their incentives arise and identified mechanisms and algorithms behind them
2. Assessed tools and techniques to distinguish between mechanisms and reason about engineering design problems
3. Took case studies of **Draw and Participatory Budgeting** to interpret real life applications of these mechanisms
4. Reviewed **Game Theory** and examined protocols, mining and the issues in **Incentives of Mining Bitcoin**
